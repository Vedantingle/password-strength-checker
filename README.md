# password-strength-checker
A real-time password strength checker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that evaluates password security and provides visual feedback.

# Password Strength Checker 🔐

The **Password Strength Checker** is a lightweight web tool that evaluates password strength in real time as the user types.  
It provides **instant visual feedback** using a strength meter and descriptive labels such as weak, moderate, and strong.

This project focuses on **user feedback, form usability, and basic security awareness**.

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time password strength evaluation
- Visual strength meter with animations
- Strength labels (Weak / Moderate / Strong)
- Show / Hide password toggle
- Clean and minimal dark UI
- Instant feedback without page reload

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and strength meter
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Password analysis logic

No frameworks. No dependencies.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The password strength is calculated based on:
- Password length
- Use of uppercase letters
- Use of numbers
- Character variety

As the user types:
- JavaScript evaluates the password
- CSS classes update dynamically
- The strength meter animates accordingly

## 4. File Naming (Fix Before Pushing)

Your files are already clean. Keep them like this:

index.html
style.css
script.js

yaml
Copy code

Good. Don’t break this habit.

## 5. Brutally Honest Review (Important)

- The logic is **basic**, not advanced security — and that’s fine.
- What makes this valuable is **instant feedback + clean UI**, not complexity.
- This is a **supporting project**, not a headline project — treat it as such.
- Splitting it into its own repo was the right call.

## 6. Your GitHub Now Looks Like This (Good Sign)

You now have:
- `forest-parallax-website` → visual interaction
- `neumorphism-calculator` → UI + logic
- `password-strength-checker` → usability + feedback

Next and final obvious one:
👉 **Starbucks Landing Page**

After that, we clean the **main repo README** and link everything properly.

Say the word for the **Starbucks Landing Page**, or if you want the **main repo polish** next.
